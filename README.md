## Test-driven development
This exercise is implemented with test-driven development (tdd) method, that has following steps:

1. Create a test that fails to the problem;
2. Write simple code solution to pass the given test;
3. Refactor the code to eliminate redundancy.

Each commit of this repository has a simple tag that identify the step of algorithm (1, 2 or 3).
